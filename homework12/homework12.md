#Team Gas Optimisation Game
Follow the README instructions for the gas optimisation team game in the
repo
These are in the Exercises\Gas directory
Your team should try to reduce the amount of gas used to deploy the contract, and when running transactions.
You can change the code as much as you like, but you must not change the tests, and your contract must pass all tests.


See the gas folder for solution
